I just want to do a mix of ogame and eve online. I really like the exploration of eve online, but not so much into pvp. also love that idea of sending a space probe to a inhabit plante to check for resources. I think the games today are too much code for nonsense. I believe in small games, no graphic but with content and good ideas. something like tetris. 

I Dunno, just trying things.
